# mini GDPR report

The **PII Overview** and **GDPR** dashboards are great for getting an immediate satellite view of the volume and types of PII in your organisation.

One of major use I can see of the product, which also benefits the speed of actioning GDPR requests, is to help organisations  control the growth of their stored PII. The platform enables an organization to not only see where their PII is located, but also to review it at an individual file level. This enables an organisation to determine if the appropriate people have access to the data and also if there is even a need to store some types of PII. 

Avoiding GDPR is not going to be possible for most companies, whereever they are based in the world. But the impact of GDPR can be reduced if the amount of PII being stored can be kept to a minimum. Less  PII means sipler and thereofre quicker GDPR response times. In addition, limiting the volume and separate locations of stored PII (incluing duplicated PII) provides huge security benefits.

In the context of reducing PII, here's how I might use the platform to investigate the storage of credit card numbers...

GDPR Dashboard - Types of Personal Data
1,640 credit card numbers:

Clicking on the "credit card" column...

GDPR Dashboard - Top Authors of Data
Looks like it is worth examining the 513 files authored by LTadashi:

Clicking on the "LTadashi" column...

GDPR Dashboard - Personal Data by Data Set
This indicates that all this PII is being stored with Marketing data:

This might be reasonable - but to verify, we should displays the results view and examine some of the at might be reasonable 
files...

This shows us many Excel documents named "TRAVEL_AUTHORIZATION". These indeed look like they are related to travel, for different people. Perhaps they are all members of the Marketing team? A question that could be asked is, if these documents really do contain credit card numbers (might need to download and view the native to confirm this), is this author LTadashi correct in storing/keeping these documents? If these files do need to be stored, can we redact the credit card numbes, to make the files less responsive to a GDPR search? If so, can we introduce a company process or automation to do this?
