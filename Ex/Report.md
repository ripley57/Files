# mini GDPR report

### Dashboards
The **PII Overview** and **GDPR** dashboards are great for getting an immediate satellite view of the PII in your organisation:

I don't know if the indexing of files can be done using "soft commits" (as is possible with Solr), but, if assuming that is possible, combining with continuous crawling (which I understand is possible), one could possibly claim that the dashboards provide a Near Real Time view of the PII in an organisation. I doubt few other similar products could claim this.

### GDPR
The location of the stored PII can be overlooked, but it is important. GDPR applies to both EU Citizens, and non-EU Citizens if their data was processed by an organisation "established" in the EU. Apparently the data processing doesn't even need to have been done in the EU. If one makes the assumption that the data was processed where it is stored, the location of the data can therefore determine if it is applicable to the GDPR.

Irrespective of if the persons concerned are EU Citizens, if the personal data is processed (i.e. collected) 
 
Most articles I you read usually only describe GDPR as involving the personal data of EU Citizens. However, I understand that the scope is much broader than this.

, hence the the e term "Data Subject". A "Data Subject", under GDPR, is apparently anyone within the borders of the EU at the time of processing of their personal data. In addition, a "Data Subject" is also anyone whose data is processed by an organisation "established" in the EU, even if the processing was done outside of the EU. What this means is that, even for companies not established in the UK, they need to be aware of GDPR and where their PII is being collected

he potential global applicability of the GDPR is not always clear and is tied the location of the Data Controller and Processor rather than the subject


Article 3 (2):
"This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union "

Article 3 (1): 
"This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union or not."
