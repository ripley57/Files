# mini GDPR report

### Introduction
The **PII Overview** and **GDPR** dashboards are great for getting an immediate satellite view of the PII in your organisation:

I don't know if the indexing of files can be done using "soft commits" (as is possible with Solr), but, if assuming that is possible, combining with continuous crawling (which I understand is possible), one could possibly claim that the dashboards provide a Near Real Time view of the PII in an organisation. I doubt few other similar products could claim this.

### Compliance with the GDPR


Critical information should be protected, but often
itâ€™s unknown where the data resides, who can access i

any company
collecting personal data on people located in the EU or for any
company doing business in the EU. For these companies, GDPR
compliance is mandatory and its reach is global.
