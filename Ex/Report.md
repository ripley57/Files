# mini GDPR report

### Dashboards
The **PII Overview** and **GDPR** dashboards are great for getting an immediate satellite view of the PII in your organisation:

I don't know if the indexing of files can be done using "soft commits" (as is possible with Solr), but, if assuming that is possible, combining with continuous crawling (which I understand is possible), one could possibly claim that the dashboards provide a Near Real Time view of the PII in an organisation. I doubt few other similar products could claim this.

### GDPR
A company needs to worry about GDPR if they have personal data on people located in the EU. This could include employees, customers, or business partners. Therefore, in addition to knowing what PII your organisation collects, you also need to determine if it belongs to an EU citizen.
