The platform enables an organization to not only see where their PII is located, but also to review it at an individual file level. This enables an organisation to determine if the appropriate people have access to the data and also if there is even a need to store some types of PII. 

Avoiding GDPR is not going to be possible for most companies, whereever they are based in the world. But the impact of GDPR can be reduced if the amount of PII being stored can be kept to a minimum.
