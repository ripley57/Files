### Dashboards
The **PII Overview** and **GDPR** dashboards are great for getting an immediate satellite view of the PII in your organisation:

I don't know if the indexing of files can be done using "soft commits" (as is possible with Solr), but, if assuming that is possible, combining with continuous crawling (which I understand is possible), one could possibly claim that the dashboards provide a Near Real Time view of the PII in an organisation. I doubt few other similar products could claim this.

One of major use I can see of the product, which also benefits the speed of actioning GDPR requests, is identifying ways for an organisation to control the growth of PII in an organisation. The platform enables an organization to not only see where their PII is located, but also to review it, enabling them to determine if the appropriate people have access to the data and also if there is even a need to store such data. 

Because the GDPR an potentially affect any company, anywhere in the world, keeping a cap on the volume and different loctions of stored PII will be a huge benefit to both the response times of GDPR requests, but also improve the security of the data.

In this context, here's an example of how I would use the platform to examine stored credit card numbers:
